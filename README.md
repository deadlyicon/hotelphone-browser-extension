## onboarding process
  - someone walks in to sign up
  - they login to facebook
    - we grab data from their facebook (and maybe linkedin)
  - we also ask the user direct questions


## Features

- their entire friends list (not friends of friends)
  - facebook id
  - name
  - thumbnails (maybe more photos)
  - scrape "userful information for building conversation prompts" TBD
  - photos have meta-data in the DOM of who is in the photo
- try to keep track of whos login we got what data from so we can delete it later



- consider using the mobile app for easier scraping
- extra: also scrape linked-in?
